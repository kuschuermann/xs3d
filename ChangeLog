	* InputHandler supports focus inquiry and will notify
	MeshFocusListenerS of changes to the focus.

	* Mesh.java: Maintains transparent array caches for speed, and
	returns these instead of Iterators on the List structures.
	Surface is now named Face. Mesh can be unfocusable.

	* Viewer3d.java: Separated the Mouse-based listeners into a
	separate InputHandler class. Viewer3d supports a “reset” action
	invoked from the InputHandler in response to pressing ctrl-L

	* GUI.java: Separated the single Mesh with green and blue X-shapes
	into two meshes, one with the green and the other with the blue
	X-shape; the blue X-shape is not focusable.
